# Applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning on Control System Environments
In this repository we have used two deep reinforcement learning algorithms on two 
control sytem simulation enviroments offered by openAI gym inorder to compare the performance across amoung the agents and setup some guidelines while dealing with these creating and using these reinforcement learning agents.

## Algorithms
The two algorithms that we analysed for this research include :
* Deep Q networks 
* Reinforce Policy Gradients

## Control System Enviroments
And the two control System Enviroments that we used in order to conduct our experiments include 
* Cartpole-v1
* LunarLander-v2

These two control systems simulation enviroments are offered by _OpenAI gym_ which is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. This toolkit supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Pinball.
